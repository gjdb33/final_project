This page is used to learn more about my life. My name is Geno Dutzy, but my real name is <i>Eugene Dutzy IV</i>. I never grew up in Missouri,
rather I was born and raised in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit">Detroit, Michigan.</a>

 - I lived in Michigan until I was about 12, then moved to <b>Saint Peters, Missouri</b>, a city just about 30 minutes outside of Saint Louis.
 Here I went to Middle School and High School, before attending here, the University of Missouri-Columbia.
