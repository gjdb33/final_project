This page is used to learn more about my life. My name is Geno Dutzy, but my real name is **Eugene Dutzy IV**. I never grew up in Missouri,
 rather I was born and raised in [Detroit, Michigan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit).

I lived in Michigan until I was about 12, then moved to **_Saint Peters, Missouri_**, a city just about 30 minutes outside of Saint Louis.
 Here I went to Middle School and High School, before attending here, the University of Missouri-Columbia.
