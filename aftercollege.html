<h1> After-College</h1>

This page is used to entail what my plans after college are. As of right now, my plan is to become a 2LT in the US Army through the ROTC program here at Mizzou. While I don't get to choose whether or not I want to go Active duty or National Guard, I hope to get Active Duty. Nor do I get to choose what job I get, I am hoping to get a job in the IT related field.
<br>
As of right now, I do not know how many years I will spend in the Army, but during my time, I hope to eventually get a Master's Degree and be able to use it for whenever my Army career is over.
